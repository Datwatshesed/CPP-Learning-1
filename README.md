## CPP-Learning-1

Hi! This is a repo where I put the code in my journey of learning C++. If you wanna join, that's fine. But since this is for personal use, most of what I write is gonna be informal, ESPECIALLY the commit messages.

So some things you should know if you wanna follow along.

If I put "c_" in front of a filename, it's because it's a version of an already existing C++ code where I use C statements, functions, and libraries.
