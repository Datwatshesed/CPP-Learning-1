## CPP-Learning-1

Hi! This is a repo where I put the code in my journey of learning C++. If you wanna join, that's fine. But since this is for personal use, most of what I write is gonna be informal, ESPECIALLY the commit messages.

This is the video I'm learning from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bYFu9mBnr4

At first, I wanted to pair this with C++ Primer, but I realize they organize their sections differently. C++ Primer will instead be in CPP-Learning-2, if I ever decide to continue learning C++ instead of just making projects and StackOverflowing everyting. 

So some things you should know if you wanna follow along.

If I put "c_" in front of a filename, it's because it's a version of an already existing C++ code where I use C statements, functions, and libraries.
